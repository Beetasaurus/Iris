# Iris Starline (Archived)

This fork is no longer needed, because Iris 1.2.0+ includes support for shader settings / config. Get it at https://irisshaders.net!

When the Starline fork was first created, Iris was an alpha-quality mod with few features. To get more features, it was common to merge together the experimental open PRs, to get things like more shader support or shader settings. Starline first emerged as a fork that merged all of these PRs together, packaged in a way that many people could easily use them without needing to merge things themselves. As Iris developed further, this became less and less necessary, until only shader settings remained as the sole unmerged feature.

As it turned out, a release-ready implementation of a functional shader config GUI was a ton of work, especially since upstream Iris chose to rewrite the shader config code instead of using the config code in Starline. But finally, the release of Iris 1.2.0 brought full & working support for shader config, removing the final need for Starline.

Since I'm now part of the Iris development team, and Iris 1.2.0+ includes shader settings, this fork no longer needs to exist. It's been archived for preservation, but there's no need to use the builds of this fork other than for historical purposes.
